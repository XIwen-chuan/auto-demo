Indications for a modified step test, performed instead on a flat surface, include chronic knee pain, hip pain, or diminished balance<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>2. Explain the rationale for the step test. One may include the history of the step test<sup>2</sup> and how pulse recovery following exercise can vary dependent upon baseline cardiovascular fitness linked to age and gender normative fitness standards<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>3. Clearly introduce to the individual that they may stop the test at any time for any reason while specifically including that they should stop the test if they feel chest pain, breathing difficulty, lightheadedness, or balance insecurity.&nbsp;</p><p>4. List the steps of the test: first, the individual will step for no longer than three minutes in duration, and second, the individual will sit down immediately and have their pulse recovery assessed using a stethoscope, with heart beat listened to and counted for one full minute.</p><p>5. Explain that test results will be reported to the individual directly after the test including an assessment of their own individual cardiovascular fitness with comparison to normative values for their age and gender.</p><p>6. Introduce the stopwatch, metronome, step, and chair that the individual will sit in after the step test completion. Position the chair so it is out of the way but convenient to access when the step test is completed. Explain that they should not talk during the procedure but that you will provide them interval progress reports every 30 seconds and then a 10-second count down as they approach the completion of the three minutes. If performing the modified step test, which is on a flat surface, introduce the area where the test will be performed. Use the metronome to indicate cadence at 96 steps/minute, but assure the individual they should perform the test at a comfortable pace for them.</p><p>7. Demonstrate performance of the step test at an appropriate cadence for 10-20 seconds. Step up and down on the step (or in place if performing on a flat surface) alternating legs.</p><p>8. Invite the individual to perform 5-6 practice steps under observation to ensure they have the correct technique and are safe to perform the test.</p><p>9. Initiate the test with close observation of the individual, counting the actual number of steps/minute and spotting for imbalance, pain, respiratory distress, or other indications that the test should be terminated early. Report to the individual completion at 30 second intervals and count down the last ten seconds of the 3-minute test.</p><p>10. Invite the individual to sit in the chair and count their heart rate for one minute either by heart auscultation using a stethoscope (recommended) or radial pulse.</p><p>11. Record the heart rate recovery (number of beats during the first one minute following the step test while sitting in the chair), number of steps/minute performed, and length of time for the test.</p><p>12. Ask the individual how they feel and how this level of exertion compares with their daily activities and exercise they currently perform. Use this information to help guide them in activities that are at an appropriate level of exertion for them to build their cardiovascular fitness.</p><p>13. Share with the individual how their performance compares with age and gender normative values with reference to test modifications (slower pace, performance on flat surface, shorter duration) that may impact this comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>14. Invite the individual to repeat the step test at 6-12 week intervals after engaging in a program to improve physical fitness as a means to assess impact of the exercise program.</p>"

Stock solutions are added to 938 mL of distilled water.\r\n\n\n1.2 Chemicals must be reagent-grade. The medium is stirred until all the contents are dissolved. **CAUTION** The pH of liquid media should be adjusted to 6.9 ± 0.1with either HCl or NaOH at strengths ≤ 1 M after adding distilled water to each stock solution.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2. Preparation of toxicant solution and test dilutions**\r\n\n\n2.1 Test dilutions\r\n\n\nTest dilutions can be prepared in volumetric flasks and then distributed to the replicate test vessels. Test vessels are left at room temperature for 1 hour to allow equilibrium of the medium and toxicant.\r\n\n\n2.2 Selection of test concentrations\r\n\n\nSet the concentration of the test substances using half dilution of the medium and the toxicity test solution. In cases of uncertainty about sample toxicity, it is beneficial to run a range-finding test for choosing concentrations of definitive test. A wide range of concentrations \\(e.g., ≥ an order of magnitude) should assist in selection of the concentrations for the definitive test.\r\n\n\nIn case the test solution is an effluent or liquid material, set the concentration to 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, and 100%. The concentration should be selected so that different levels \\(4-5 sections) of growth can occur in the range of less than 10% to over 90%. It is best to choose the range of concentrations through preliminary experiments, which includes broad range of concentrations.\r\n\n\n2.3 Control\r\n\n\nAll experiments require a negative control with the identical culture medium, test conditions and procedures, but exclude the test substance.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3. Transfer of test organisms**\r\n\n\nSort out fronds of duckweed that are dark green and consist of two or three identical leaves attached; The roots of selected fronds are excised using stainless steel scissors \\(**Fig. 1a,b**); Place individual rootless plants in each cell of a 24-well plates by using tweezers \\(**Fig. 1c,d**)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**4. Culture**\r\n\n\nAs a standard condition, the test organism is cultured at 25℃ with continuous white light of 90-100 μmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup>. The duration of the _Lemna* root growth inhibition test is 72 hours. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**5. Methods of measurements**\r\n\n\nAfter 72 h of culture, harvest all plants and place them on glass slides and measure the length of the longest roots using an image analyzer **\\(Fig. 2)**. An individual plant generally has 2-3 fronds each with one root."

For running the algorithm with another dataset, navigate within MATLAB to the “work” folder \\(i.e., the folder containing the dataset of interest), and double-click on it.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Using MLM algorithm**\r\n\n\nMLM algorithm was built to divide the spectral cohort into training and test sets. The training set should contain 70% of the samples, and the test set 30% of the samples. For this, firstly it is necessary to calculate how many samples must be assigned to the training and test set. For example, in the example dataset depicted in Figure 2a, class 1 is divided into 98 samples for training \\(70%, 0.7  ** 140 = 98) and 42 samples for test \\(30%, 0.3 ** 140 = 42); and class 2 is divided into 70 samples for training \\(70%, 0.7  ** 100 = 70) and 30 samples for test \\(30%, 0.3 ** 100 = 30).\r\n\n\nAfter the number of training and test sample for each class is calculated, the algorithm should be applied by typing the commands depicted in Figure 2b in the MATLAB Command Window. In this figure, the following steps are performed:\r\n\n\n\\(1) Sample splitting for class 1, where 98 is the number of training samples and 42 is the number of test samples:\r\n\n\n\\[Train1,Test1,Group_Train1,Group_Test1] = mlm\\(X1,Y1,98,42);\r\n\n\n\\(2) Sample splitting for class 2, where 70 is the number of training samples and 30 is the number of test samples:\r\n\n\n\\[Train2,Test2,Group_Train2,Group_Test2] = mlm\\(X2,Y2,70,30);\r\n\n\n\\(3) Building the Training set by combining the training samples of class 1 and 2:\r\n\n\nTrain=\\[Train1;Train2];\r\n\n\n\\(4) Building the Test set by combining the test samples of class 1 and 2:\r\n\n\nTest=\\[Test1;Test2];\r\n\n\n\\(5) Building the group category representing the training samples:\r\n\n\nGroup_Train=\\[Group_Train1;Group_Train2];\r\n\n\n\\(6) Building the group category representing the test samples:\r\n\n\nGroup_Test=\\[Group_Test1;Group_Test2];\r\n\n\nFor more than two classes, the procedure is the same, where the sample splitting is performed for each class separately. The random-mutation factor is set as 10% \\(default).\r\n\n\nCAUTION. The number of training and test samples for each class must be an integer value. In the case of 70% and 30% generate numbers with decimal places, they must be rounded to the closest integer value \\(e.g., 25.7 to 26; 14.2 to 14; 70.9 to 71; etc)."

Once these measurements have been taken, move the syringes to the VTA coordinates \\(AP -3.3mm; LM +1.05mm; DV -4.6mm). \r\n  16. Using a micro-drill, make burr holes at the new coordinates.\r\n  17. Fill the entire syringe with PBS and then push out the solution until 1.5 μl of the syringe is full.\r\n  18. Pull up to 2.0 μl with air.\r\n  19. Fill the syringe with 1.0 μl of AAV-DIO-ChR2 \\(total volume of syringe is now 3.0 μl).\r\n  20. Lower syringe to 0.1 mm below the newly calculated dorsal/ventral coordinates to create a pocket in the tissue and then immediately pull up to the calculated coordinate.\r\n  21. Inject 0.1 μl of virus per minute to avoid tissue damage.\r\n  22. Keep syringe in place for 5 minutes after all of the virus has been injected.\r\n  23. Remove the Hamilton syringes by slowly pulling up and remove mouse from stereotaxic apparatus.\r\n  24. Apply neosporin to the skull using a cotton swab.\r\n  25. Close incision using sutures holding the two sides of the tissue with forceps.\r\n  26. Place mouse on heating pad in its cage until it wakes up.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Injection of retrograde travelling pseudorabies virus expressing Cre \\(PRV-Cre) into NAc or mPFC followed by implantation of permanent optical fibers \\(see Sparta _et al_ Nature Protocols for details on how to make fibers):**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Two weeks following the DIO-ChR2 surgery, perform the second surgery.  The protocol is the same as above for the virus injection with a few alterations.\r\n  a. After step \\(8), choose a location for the skull screw that is not near bregma, the viral injection location or the ferrule location and then proceed to drill a small burr hole.  Screw the skull screw into the small hole using curved forceps to hold the screw and screwdriver to fit into the hole.  Only screw until it has tightly gripped the skull. Proceed with flat test.\r\n\n\nb.  Inject PRV-Cre into the NAc  at 10° \\(AP +1.6mm; LM +1.5mm; DV -4.4mm) and at 15° mPFC \\(AP +1.7mm; LM +0.75mm; DV -2.5mm), and use a 0.5 μl volume of the virus to inject bilaterally.\r\n\n\n2. Remove Hamilton syringes and replace with ferrule holders with implantable fibers attached and change the angle to 7°.\r\n  3. Determine the location for ferrule placement from bregma for VTA \\(AP -3.3mm; LM +1.05mm; DV -4.6mm). \r\n  4. Secure the ferrules in place with white dental cement. \r\n  5. Do not remove the ferrule holders until the cement is completely dry \\(~10-15 minutes).\r\n  6. Remove the mouse and allow it to recover on the heating pad.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Subthreshold social defeat:**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Place a c57 test mouse \\(intruder) into the home cage of a larger, CD1 retired breeder mouse for 2 minutes during which the test mouse is physically attacked by the CD1 aggressive mouse.   \r\n  2. After 2 minutes of physical contact, place a perforated plexiglass partition in the middle of the CD1 mouse home cage and separate the test mouse from the CD1 mouse for 10 minutes to allow for sensory stress or optical stimulation \\(see below).\r\n  3. Following the 10 minutes of sensory stress or optical stimulation, place the test mouse back into its home cage for 5 minutes.\r\n  4. Repeat steps 1 and 2. \r\n  5. Return the test mouse to its home cage.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Optical stimulation and social interaction:**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Optical stimulation can be performed during subthresold social defeat as stated above or during social interaction test \\(see below).\r\n  2. Connect optical fibers via a FC/PC adaptor to a 473 nm blue or 561 nm yellow laser diode and stimulator to generate blue or yellow light pulses.\r\n  3. Attach the other end of the optical fibers, with a ferrule attached, to the two implanted optical fibers in the test mouse using ferrule sleeves.\r\n  4. For low frequency, tonic light stimulation set the stimulator to 0.5Hz and 15 ms.\r\n  5. For high frequency, phasic light stimulation set the stimulator to 20Hz and 40 ms.\r\n  6. For both tonic and phasic stimulation protocols, expose projection-specific VTA  neurons to 5 spikes over each 10 second period.\r\n  7. Set the stimulator to the desired parameters and turn the laser on during the two-stages of the social interaction test.\r\n  8. To measure social avoidance behavior towards a novel CD1 mouse, perform a two-stage social interaction test.\r\n  9. During the first 2.5 minutes of the test, allow the test mouse to freely explore a square shaped arena \\(44 x 44 cm) containing a wire mesh cage \\(10 x 6 cm) placed on one side of the area with the target CD1 mouse absent. Ensure that the laser is on during these 2.5 minutes.\r\n  10. Turn the laser off, remove the test mouse from the arena and place it back into its home cage.\r\n  11. Place an unfamiliar CD1 mouse into the wire mesh cage and place it into the arena.\r\n  12. Turn the laser back on and place the test mouse into the arena, allowing it to freely explore.\r\n  13. Use video tracking software to measure the amount of time the experimental mouse spent in the “Interaction Zone” \\(14 x 26 cm), “Corner Zone” \\(10 x 10 cm) and “Total Travel” within the arena.\r\n  14. To segregate mice as susceptible or resilient, calculate the interaction ratio as \\(interaction time with target present)/\\(interaction time with target absent) normalized to 100.  \r\n  15. Mice with scores less than 100 are defined as “susceptible” and those with scores greater than or equal to 100 are defined as “unsusceptible” or resilient."

            "procedure" : "<p><strong>Provide low barrier rapid turn-around-time PCR testing</strong></p><p>In a setting with community transmission of COVID-19, index cases are diagnosed either after referral by contact tracers or following screening for other reasons associated with an increased risk of infection<sup>7–10</sup>. For a Test, Trace, Isolate, Quarantine (TTIQ) cascade to be effective, coverage and timeliness of testing are pivotal since a delayed first step has knock-on effects downstream <sup>2,3</sup>. PCR testing on an upper respiratory sample (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection with regards to sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy<sup>11</sup>. PCR testing can pick up infections earliest, when the viral load has not yet reached its peak, expediting the contact tracing process. They also remain positive longer than rapid antigen tests do, which is of particular importance when implementing bidirectional contact tracing, where the aim is to identify the parent case (the infector of the index case) and sibling cases (infected by the same infector) in addition to child cases (persons infected by the index case). </p><p>Barriers to testing experienced by individuals may relate to confusion and uncertainty regarding testing guidelines and where to go for testing, lack of accessible testing locations, perceptions that the nasal swab method is too painful, and long wait times for testing results<sup>12</sup>. We minimized these barriers by conveniently locating our testing centee in a centrally placed University building (<em>Figure 1</em>). Tests were made free of charge. Appointments could be made online by all students without prior triage. Testing indications were broadened for students to include “self-assessed risk” from February 2021 onward (see <em>Figure 2 panel A</em>) and communicated widely through email, the University website, national media and a social media campaign, to which student organisations actively contributed (<em>Figure 1</em>). </p><p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This approach was successful in increasing the number of tests performed in the target population. Between weeks 5 and 21, a period encompassing a wave of infections in Belgium, a total of 3.92 tests were performed per 1,000 students daily in the University testing center. When adding the tests carried out in students at other testing centers, an estimated 6.8 tests per 1,000 students daily were performed. In contrast, 4.48 tests per 1000 persons were performed daily in a national control group, selected through random sampling stratified by age <strong>(</strong><em>Figure 3 panel C)</em>. The much lower test positivity rate (3.64%) in the student testing center as compared to the national control group (8.27%) further underscores the higher intensity of testing in our target population. </p><p>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p>Testing was readily available and fast. When COVID-19 like symptoms were the indication for testing, the mean and median time between symptom onset and test administration were 3.1 and 3 days respectively, highlighting students’ ability to recognize suggestive symptoms and respond accurately by booking a diagnostic test. The mean and median time between booking of the test and its administration was 11.8 and 11.7 hours respectively for this group, highlighting rapid availability of appointments for testing. Turn-around-time between test administration and reporting was a mean of 9.12 hours (median 7.83 hours) for tests finally classified as positive and a mean of 7.79 hours (median 7.48 hours) for tests finally classified as negative, which was the result of close cooperation with the collaborating diagnostic laboratory. Students were informed about their test results through one of several mobile phone apps and government websites, reducing reporting delays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Integrate the IT infrastructure for testing and contact tracing</strong></p><p>In order to optimise the flow of information and increase the efficiency of testing and contact tracing, we developed a custom server based version of <em>Go.Data</em>, an outbreak investigation tool developed by the WHO and GOARN (Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network) partners<sup>14</sup>. The system was integrated with a custom appointment module and a laboratory information system. (<em>Figure 3</em>).</p><p>An appointment module is accessed through a secure University login system. Upon submission of the online appointment form, the scheduled time slot, the student’s contact details, testing indication and current address are loaded into <em>Go.Data</em>. If the inputted phone number (unique key) is already known, inputs are stored under the existing case file. Otherwise, a new case file is created. </p><p>On the morning of sample collection, students are invited by email to list their recent activities and the phone numbers of attendants via an online web form. These details are automatically loaded into <em>Go.Data </em>to create an event based social network linking existing and new case files<sup>15</sup>. Between weeks 8 and 21, 30.9% of tested students filled in this form.</p><p>Just prior to sampling, student workers manning the test centre administration desks query the patient about symptom onset, vaccination status, recent exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case and that case’s identity, recent attendance at high risk events, recent travel and living situation. All the information is entered in a structured format in the <em>Go.Data </em>case file.</p><p>Once available, PCR test results are pushed to <em>Go.Data</em> by the laboratory information system and matched to existing case files. </p><p>In case of a positive test result, a contact tracer conducts a thorough phone-based interview of the index case as soon as possible after the result is reported. Information about recent activities and attendants is collected again during this conversation, entered into an online web form, and loaded into the event based social network in <em>Go.Data.</em></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All close contacts are contacted and referred for testing as soon as possible and 7 days after last exposure. Residents sharing facilities with the index case are quarantined and tested either once or twice depending on results of the first round of tests. Their follow up status is recorded in <em>Go.Data</em> and an outcome registered after follow-up phone calls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Integrate human processes for testing and contact tracing</strong></p><p>Testing and tracing operations are coordinated on a daily basis by a team of medical doctors, researchers and logistical coordinators. The contact tracing team is physically located adjacent to the testing center and visible to students attending for testing. Workers are assigned to administration desks, sample collection or contact tracing depending on their background, skills and preferences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A case or cluster is followed up by one case manager, who can be assisted by one or several contact tracers, allowing for the integration of information from different sources. This approach seems to help with quality of work and worker morale. </p><p>The administration desks in the testing center function as “flagging stations” for referral of attendants to the contact tracing team for a live interview or follow up by phone in any of the following situations: they report a possible source case or source event which is unknown to the team, they are part of a cluster which is known to the contact tracing team but requires additional assessment or they had a positive antigen test either at home (0.21% of our attendants between February and June 2021) or in the context of a clinical trial at the test center (1.02% of attendants between the 22<sup>nd </sup>of February and the 30<sup>th</sup> of May).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engage the community</strong></p><p>Engaging communities in public health programs has been shown to improve such programs’ overall effectiveness<sup>16</sup>. In the context of the COVID-19 response and contact tracing in particular, community engagement is recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) <sup>17–19</sup>. Engaging the student community has been front and center in our approach<sup>20</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our program has been heavily based on student workers functioning as a community workforce from the outset and throughout. Over a period of one year, a total of 698 students (2.12% of the estimated target population) contributed to the University’s testing and contact tracing program as a paid worker. Their engagement with peers fosters trust and familiarity, they are able to assess risks related to particular activities and venues and they function as ambassadors of the program to their social circle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The target population is regularly informed of the latest measures and guidelines through University specific channels (emails, web-page, social media, information sessions, <em>Figure 1 panel b</em>) and student organisations. A hotline and email address are manned by the testing and tracing team 7 days a week, allowing students to ask for advice or support on any COVID-19 related issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Care provision by students for students is a central theme in all operations and communication. In any interaction, students are empowered to manage the spread of infection in their social circle, by providing relevant medical knowledge in detail and by taking into account their own preferences. Student contact tracers are provided with updated training material on the latest guidelines and trained in communication skills. The training stresses care provision, empathy, active listening and avoidance of appointing blame. They initiate the tracing conversation by explaining the University's mandate for performing contact tracing and the contact tracing process itself and they invite question and answer exchange. Index cases are linked to quarantine support provided by the municipality if required. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hands on medical supervision of the contact tracing team ensures expertise and continuity. Every index case is phoned by a medical doctor attached to the University health center for tailored health advice. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Several numerical indicators exemplify the high level of community engagement achieved within the KU Leuven test &amp; trace program<sup>17,20</sup>. First, of the 729 students with a positive test in the period from February to May 2021, only six could not be contacted by the contact tracing team, demonstrating the team’s ability to reach index cases effectively and the target population’s responsiveness. Second, as previously mentioned, 30.9% of students undergoing a diagnostic test at the testing center from weeks 8 to 21 shared recent activities and contacts with the KU Leuven testing and tracing team regardless of them having a positive result. Third, of the 2691 contacts newly identified during contact tracing, 2403 (89.3%) underwent at least one diagnostic test, showing high compliance with guidance provided. Fourth, of the students booking a test between weeks 8 and 21 of 2021, 54.9% reported having Belgium’s proximity tracing app on their phones since at least one week<sup>21</sup>. In contrast, nationwide there had been 2.76 million downloads of CoronAlert by the end of May 2021, which corresponds to 30,4% of the number of smartphones in use in Belgium in the fall of 2020 (data provided by the CoronAlert team). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Implement an extended contact tracing window</strong></p><p>Despite ubiquitous rollout of contact tracing to counteract the spread of COVID-19, few countries have been spared from widespread community transmission, highlighting the need for more effective tracing strategies<sup>1,2</sup>. In the context of the KU Leuven testing and contact tracing program, we have opted to implement bidirectional contact tracing by introducing a combination of an extended contact tracing window and testing of contacts both immediately and 7 days after exposure to an index case. This approach has shown the potential to markedly improve control of community transmission of COVID-19 in modelling studies<sup>5,15</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bidirectional contact tracing combines forward contact tracing and backward contact tracing. Forward contact tracing of an index case (the person diagnosed with COVID-19 undergoing contact tracing) intends to interrupt onward transmission from child cases (persons infected by the index case)<sup>15,22–24</sup>. In practice, this means identifying contacts of the index case up to two days before symptom onset or positive test, whichever is earlier<sup>25,26</sup>. Backward contact tracing attempts to identify a larger part of the transmission tree, by looking for the parent case (the infector of the index case) and sibling cases (infected by the same infector) in addition<sup>15,22–24</sup>. However, to our knowledge there is no standardised protocol on how to achieve this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our experience, the only way to identify source events for most index cases is to systematically test all recent contacts in a period before onset of symptoms (or positive test) which is sufficiently long to include the source event in most instances (<em>Figure 4</em>)<sup>27</sup>. Our extended contact tracing window goes back 7 days before onset of symptoms or positive test. In this period, all the index case’s contacts at risk are identified. Contacts are labelled as a close contact requiring quarantine and testing if they were reported by the index case as having had either direct physical contact, an interaction at less than 1.5 meters without face masks, an interaction at less than 1.5 meters for more than 15 minutes or an interaction without face masks for more than 15 minutes. Also included as close contacts were co-attendants at a “high risk event” of up to 20 attendees, defined as fitting at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: crowding (at least 5 individuals belonging to at least two households), close contact (&lt;1,5 meters without masks) and closed environment (indoor). </p><p>Each contact thus identified is notified of their risk, and advised to undergo an PCR test as soon as possible. If the test is negative, the contact is asked to quarantine until a second test 7 days after exposure, regardless of immune status. Quarantine is ended if this test is negative. Each contact is also advised to undergo an PCR test as soon as possible if symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 appear. Individuals having recently used the same facilities as the index case in student housing are asked to quarantine until screened. The detection of an additional infection in this group leads to quarantine and a second round of testing 7 days later.</p>"

Finger-prick dried blood spots (DBS) were collected on cards before and 5 hours after the breakfast, to provide a clinic-based comparison to the at-home DBS tests. Between blood sampling, participants were trained in how to complete the home-phase of the study, including when and how to consume standardised test meals, perform DBS tests, and use the Zoe study app (see below). Upon completing their baseline visit, participants received all the components necessary to complete the home-phase as a take-home pack. The take-home pack contained: 1) Standardised meals for the home-phase; 2) DBS equipment and return envelopes (collection equipment plus 4x aluminium bags and one master pre-paid return envelope for returning these bags); 3) Stool sample collection kit; 4) Pre-paid return kit (box or envelope with 2 separate packs for stool and equipment) with postage-paid packs to return the activity monitor, the CGM and the stool sample.</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Home-phase (Days 2-14)</u></em></p><p>During the study home-phase, participants consumed multiple standardised test meals over a 9-11 day period, differing in macronutrient composition (carbohydrate, fat, protein and fiber), outlined in <strong>Table 3, </strong>while wearing the CGM and activity monitor. Participants recorded all of their dietary intake, satiety and exercise on the Zoe study app as outlined below throughout the study. DBS tests were completed on Days 2, 3, 4, and 5 before and after test meals. Participants also provided a stool sample upon completion of the study on Day 14. Following completion of the home-phase, participants returned all study samples and devices to study staff via standard mail.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Standardized test meals</u></p><p>Upon completing their clinical visit, participants received a pack of standardized test meals to take home for consumption, and were instructed on how to store and consume the meals. The study had a total of 3 test meal protocol groups (described in <strong>Table</strong> <strong>4</strong>). Standard test meals were consumed at breakfast during the first 9-11 days (Days 2-12) of the home period, and additionally for lunch on Days 2 and 3. The at-home meals were:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Meal 1. Metabolic Challenge Meal:</strong> High fat, low carbohydrate muffins and milkshake (as was used for clinical visit breakfast)</p><p><strong>Meal 2. Medium Fat &amp; Carb:</strong> average level of fat and carbohydrate muffins</p><p><strong>Meal 3. High Fat 1:</strong> high fat, low carbohydrate muffins</p><p><strong>Meal 4. High Carb:</strong> high carbohydrate, low fat muffins</p><p><strong>Meal 5. OGTT</strong>: oral glucose tolerance test (liquid high carbohydrate drink)</p><p><strong>Meal 6. High Fiber: </strong>high fiber meal consisting of two fiber bars and muffins</p><p><strong>Meal 7. High Fat 2:</strong> high fat, low carbohydrate muffins</p><p><strong>Meal 8. High Protein: </strong>high protein meal consisting of a milkshake and muffins.</p><p><br></p><p>Participants received clear instructions (verbal and written) on how and when the meals were to be consumed and recorded in the Zoe study app, as described below. Standardized meals were provided frozen and participants were therefore instructed to store these in the freezer upon arriving at home. Each evening, participants were instructed to transfer the meals for the following day from the freezer to the refrigerator, so they were defrosted in time for consumption. Participants were instructed to fast for a minimum of 8 hours prior to consuming a test breakfast meal and to limit exercise and drink only still, not sparkling, water in moderation during fasting periods (including during the overnight fast).</p><p>In addition to water, participants were allowed to have one tea or coffee with their muffin-based set breakfasts. Tea or coffee could contain up to 40 mL 0.1% (skimmed) fat cow’s milk, and no sugar or other sweeteners were not allowed. If participants consumed coffee or tea with their breakfasts, they were instructed to consume this drink consistently, in the same strength and amount, alongside all muffin-based test meals throughout the study. Participants could choose to consume a single tea or coffee alongside their lunch meal, subject to the same restrictions as the breakfast drink, and were asked to keep this drink consistent between test lunches on the study. They were instructed to consume all muffin-based meals within 10 minutes and the OGTT meal within 5 minutes, and to notify study staff if this was not achieved. After consuming their breakfast, participants were instructed to fast for 3 or 4 hours after meal consumption (depending on test meal protocol; protocol Group 1 had a fasting period of 3 hours for Meal 5, and 4 hours for all other meals; in Groups 2 and 3 had a fasting period of 3 hours for all breakfast meals, excluding combinations of breakfast and lunch, where fasting periods were 4 and 2 hours, respectively). They were advised to limit exercise and drink only plain, still water and when possible and safe, to avoid taking any over-the-counter medication during fasting periods.</p><p>Participants were instructed to not consume any food or drink other than water alongside the OGTT (Meal 5), to refrain from movement or activity as much as possible for the first hour following the breakfast, and avoid physical activity during the 3-hour fasting period that followed it.&nbsp;Participants were allowed to consume other foods as they normally would once they had completed the fasting period on the study day.&nbsp;Test meals and any dietary intake consumed within fasting periods, including accompanying drinks, were recorded in the Zoe study app by participants with the exact time at consumption and ingredient quantities so that compliance could be monitored by study staff. Only test meals that were completed according to instructions were included in analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Test meal preparation</u></em></p><p>Test meals were prepared and packaged in the Dietetics Kitchen (Department of Nutritional Sciences, King’s College London, London, UK) using standard ingredients; plain flour, sugar, baking powder, vanilla essence, milk, egg, salt, high-oleic sunflower oil, whey protein powder, chocolate milkshake powder (Nesquik, Nestle, Gatwick, UK), and commercially available fiber bars (Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Fibre One, General Mills, MN, US; Goodness Bar Apple &amp; Walnut, The Food Doctor, Hessle, UK). All test meal muffins were stored frozen until delivery to participants, who were instructed to store them frozen at home. Powder sachets and fiber bars were stored at room temperature until consumption, while long-life milk was stored at room temperature until delivery to the participant and then refrigerated in their home-phase. Test meals baked for use by the US cohort were shipped frozen, under temperature controlled-conditions, to the US to limit variability of the intervention. Test meal drinks were prepared by the participant at home by mixing pre-portioned powder sachets with long-life milk provided (Meal 1: Metabolic Challenge Meal, 220 mL 0.1% fat milk; Meal 8: High Protein, 200 mL 1.6% fat milk). The OGTT consisted of a pre-portioned powdered glucose sachet which participants mixed with 300 mL water in the UK. In the US, participants were provided with pre-mixed OGTTs ready for consumption (Cat# 82028-512; VWR, US).</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Blinding and assignment of interventions</u></em></p><p>The PREDICT study followed a total of 3 different test meal protocols. The first 196 participants (Group 1, UK only) received 9 meals to be consumed for the first 9 days of the at-home phase, and completed DBS corresponding to the Medium Fat &amp; Carb meal (Meal 2) and the “High Fat 1” meal (Meal 3) in duplicate. Following a pre-planned interim analysis in August 2018, the study team revised the protocol for Group 2 of the study (n=380 UK, n=2 US) with 2 additional breakfasts (High Protein (Meal 8) in duplicate, randomised between Days 10-12) and lunches (Medium Fat &amp; Carb (Meal 2), on Days 2 and 3). The High Fat 1 breakfast (Meal 3) was substituted with a new higher fat breakfast, “High Fat 2” (Meal 7) followed by a Medium Fat &amp; Carb lunch (Meal 2) to increase the fat content of the existing meal and elicit a higher TG response, in order to reach detectable limits for DBS analysis. The High Protein meal (Meal 8) was added to investigate the effect of protein on glycaemic responses, given that high study compliance up to this date made an additional meal possible. This group completed DBS corresponding to the High Fat 2 meal (Meal 7) and Medium Fat &amp; Carb (Meal 2) as the breakfast and lunch combination, and the High Carb (Meal 4) stand-alone breakfast. The final test meal protocol, Group 3 (n=405 UK, n=93 US), mirrored Group 2 in both meals and DBS, with the exception of two days; (1) On Day 3, participants consumed the a Metabolic Challenge breakfast (Meal 1) instead of Meal 7 to compare TG response between clinic- and home-based DBS, followed by a Medium Fat &amp; Carb lunch; (2) the displaced High Fat 2 breakfast (Meal 7) was moved to between Days 10-12 and one High Protein breakfast (Meal 8) was eliminated. A full summary of the meals consumed by each Group appears in <strong>Table 4</strong>.&nbsp;Meal order in each group was randomised using Microsoft Access for each participant, using a 2-block randomisation and 1 non-randomised block as denoted in <strong>Table 4.</strong></p><p>Participants were blinded to the nutrient composition of test meals. Test meals were labelled with a barcode and randomization code to allow study staff to identify the composition of the meal consumed, but were also labelled with text for the participant as “Day 1”, “Day 2”, etc. so that they consumed meals on the proper day according to their randomisation scheme. To log their consumption of the test meal, participants were asked to scan the barcode with the Zoe study app immediately before consumption.</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Food logging mobile study app.</u></em></p><p>The Zoe study app was developed to support the PREDICT 1 study by serving as an electronic notebook of study tasks, a tool for recording all dietary intake and a portal for communication with study staff. The app sent participants notifications and reminders to complete tasks at certain time-points, such as when their test lunch meals and DBS were due. The app also prompted participants to report their hunger and alertness levels on visual analogue scales truncated from Flint <em>et al</em><sup>8</sup>,<sup> </sup>by displaying the questions “how hungry are you?” and “how alert are you?” above the scales, at 0 minutes (time of logging) and regular intervals thereafter following the logging of a breakfast, lunch or dinner meal<em>. </em>Participants were asked to log in the study app any exercise which would not be well captured by a wrist-affixed accelerometer, such as cycling or weight-lifting, where their wrists were stationary during the exercise. Participants logged their full dietary intake using the study app over the 14-day study period, including all standardized test meals and free-living foods, beverages (including water) and medications. Data logged into the Zoe study app was uploaded onto a digital dashboard in real time and reviewed and assessed for logging accuracy and study guideline compliance by study staff.</p><p>Study staff trained all participants at their baseline clinic visit on how to accurately weigh and record dietary intake through the Zoe study app, using photographs, product barcodes, product-specific portion sizes, and digital scales. The Zoe study app contained a database of generic and branded food items with nutritional information sourced from generic data sources (Composition of Food Integrated Dataset (COFID), https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/composition-of-foods-integrated-dataset-cofid; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/), commercial food databases under license (Nielsen; Tesco; Nutritionix), back-of-pack information from commercial providers, and publicly available restaurant nutritional data. It also allowed participants to photograph back of pack labels in cases where this information was missing from the nutritional database, and where possible the photographed information was entered into the database by study staff. Study staff reviewed all data logged into the study app by participants and were able to identify potential food logging errors by comparing the logged portion sizes with attached photographs. Any uncertainties were actively clarified with the participant through the app messaging system or via phone while the participant was on the study in real time. Free-living dietary data logged through the app was categorised into separate meals for analysis against continuous glucose data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Participant recruitment and compliance</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Recruitment and eligibility screening</u></em></p><p>In the UK, participants (target n = 1,000) were recruited from the TwinsUK cohort, an ongoing research cohort described elsewhere<sup>11</sup> and the general population using online advertising (<strong>Figure 2a</strong>). In the US, participants (target n = 100) were recruited through online advertising, research participant databases and Rally for Research (<a href=\"https://rally.partners.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://rally.partners.org/</a>), an online recruiting portal for research trials (<strong>Figure 2b</strong>). During an initial recruitment interaction with study staff, participants were screened minimally for eligibility criteria (e.g. phone compatibility for the logging app, pregnancy, food allergies to test meal components) and to answer any questions from participants. If potential subjects were interested in participating and remained eligible, they then underwent a detailed eligibility assessment performed by a study coordinator over the phone. Participants were provided with an informational booklet as a “Participant Information Sheet” that fully described the study including both the clinical and at-home phase of the study to assist in the informed consent process.</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Participant compliance</u></em></p><p>In the event of possible protocol non-compliance or if the CGM was damaged, fell off, or experienced a general failure, the following approaches were taken and priority was given to those completing and obtaining glucose data for the at-home meals. If a CGM was damaged or fell off within Days 2-12 of the home-phase (when test meals were in progress), study staff provided a replacement CGM. If this occurred during the free-living Days 13-14 (after test meals were complete), the monitor was not replaced. Whenever possible, CGMs were replaced within 24 hours, and the participant was asked to pause their test meals until the new CGM arrived. Free-living days were changed to test meal days where necessary for participants to complete all test meals. As long as the CGM was replaced within a maximum of 48 hours, the participant was able to complete all test meals within the standard at-home period of the trial.</p><p>If for any unforeseen reason a replacement CGM was not provided within 48 hours, the participant was given the option to continue past the 14 days to complete all test meals, such that their responses for all meals would be recorded. In the event of a test meal error (e.g. muffins were not consumed with their designated milkshake or fiber bars as per labelled instructions), participants were provided with the option to repeat the meal on either Day 13 or Day 14 if the research team was able to provide the participant with a replacement meal, within the 14 day period.</p><p>All participants must have consumed the baseline breakfast and provided baseline fasting bloods. Failure to meet these two requirements resulted in termination of continued study participation as other endpoints would have been of no value. If any other sample collections, dietary interventions, or blood timepoints were missed or unable to be completed, the subjects continued with participation and these missing items were logged by the study staff.</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Adverse events (AE) monitoring</u></em></p><p>As the study was a dietary intervention study, safety monitoring focused on unanticipated events involving risks to participants, including any unanticipated medical occurrence in a patient or study subject. Serious AEs (SAEs) were considered those that resulted in death, were life threatening, required or prolonged hospitalization, or resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. AEs were recorded and reported to the Principal Investigator (PI) at each site and the sponsor of the study. All SAEs, both related and unrelated, were recorded and reported immediately to the PI and the sponsor as well as appropriate research ethics committees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><u>Participant retention </u></em></p><p>Given the complexity of the study, there was a high-risk of non-compliance without study staff support. As a result, we tried to ensure that we kept participants motivated and supported to be able to comply. The key objective of the clinical research coordination staff at St. Thomas’s Hospital and MGH and the in-study engagement team (through study app interactions) was to anticipate and troubleshoot any issues before they arose by designing engagement such that it increases compliance; striking a balance between overcontact and support; emphasizing the motivation for completing the study and to continuously motivate and engage. In addition to the study booklet and the training sessions delivered during the baseline clinical visit, two methods were used: pro-active engagement – calls and in-app messages to participants at predefined points in time in order to remind them, congratulate/motivate them or support them in certain actions; and reactive engagement – calls and/or in-app messages to participants based on certain real-time compliance triggers to help educate and support them in logging certain things better (particularly around dry blood spots and meals). The engagement team used a monitoring dashboard which summarized compliance measures by participant, specifically the recordings of their test meals, DBS, and free-living consumption with the aid of photographs, participant-written notes and nutritional information where available. This dashboard was a key tool in ensuring high study compliance as the engagement team actively corrected miscompliance and clarified any uncertainties in real time. The engagement team was available 7 days a week and had a process to ensure that even out of hours inquiries were answered expediently. They utilized a 2-level escalation process for questions that involved scientific input and/or any AE reporting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Ethics and dissemination</strong></p><p>Ethical approval for the study was obtained in the UK from the Research Ethics Committee and Integrated Research Application System (IRAS 236407) and in the US from the Institutional Review Board (Partners Healthcare IRB 2018P002078). The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT03479866) and was run in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Study procedures were only carried out after having received written informed consent from each participant.</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Informed consent process</u></em></p><p>Interested participants were sent the participant information sheet and informed consent form by mail or by email, at least 2 weeks before their baseline visit was scheduled to allow adequate time to read it, understand the protocol, the risks and burdens and benefits, and be provided an opportunity to ask questions.&nbsp;Only participants who had the capacity to provide consent for themselves were recruited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Consent was collected by the designated HSP/GCP trained researchers responsible for conducting the study at each site, who were experienced in patient communication and consent taking. The researcher discussed in detail the procedures that would happen as part of the study prior to collecting consent. The researcher also explained to the participants that they are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time without obligation to give a reason. Participants were explicitly given the opportunity to ask any additional questions before they signed the consent form. The participant was provided with a copy of their signed and dated consent form and any other written information and were instructed to retain these documents. It was essential that participants fully understand the requirements of the study, and therefore participants without a good understanding of verbal or written English were not included in the study. Translation and interpretation was not accommodated as the at-home phase of the study required that participants use the food logging app which was unavailable in other languages.</p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>5. Protocol versions and amendments</strong></p><p>The UK PREDICT study followed 3 major protocols between June 2018 – May 2019, with the first version being approved by the Hampstead Research Ethics Committee on 27 March 2018. The second version (v1.1) contained a simplified protocol with the removal of using bio-impedance to measure body composition. The first participants were enrolled in June 2018 under Protocol v1.1.</p><p>&nbsp;A second amendment (Protocol v1.2)&nbsp;allowed additional test meals to be included in the home-phase (described earlier, <strong>Table 4</strong>) and participants’ logging of gut transit time by using a Metabolic Challenge Breakfast (Meal 1) at clinic dyed blue with food coloring. The DBS protocol was also changed; the original DBS at-home protocol tested both TG and C-peptide on Days 2-5 (Group 1). Following an interim study break in August 2018, it was found that the DBS protocol should be optimised by changing the timing of DBS tests according to physiological peaks in biomarkers (TG or C-peptide) and by increasing the fat and carbohydrate content of test meals on DBS days to exaggerate the response. Starting on 28 Aug 2018, TG was measured on Days 2-3 at fasting, 300 and 360 minutes post-prandially following test meals as described above, while C-peptide was quantified on Days 4-5 at fasting, 30 and 120 minutes post-prandially as described for Group 2. Protocol v1.2 also included a second saliva sample collection on the clinic day, at 30 minutes after the metabolic challenge breakfast, to measure salivary amylase production post prandially and provide a comparison to fasted amylase levels. A further amendment (v1.3) was approved to lower the lower BMI limit for eligibility to 16.5kg/m<sup>2</sup> (originally 20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Meal changes which resulted in Group 3 were implemented in January 2019.</p><p>Multiple other minor changes not impacting the intervention or primary study outcomes were made to the protocol internally. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during the clinical visit was introduced on 8 Aug 2018 as an exploratory measure to potentially use as an input variable in predicting metabolic responses to meals.</p><p>A ‘cracker test’ (using Carr’s Table Water or Rakusen’s Snackers) was added to the protocol on 9 July 2018 as an exploratory test for potential use an input variable in data analysis to predict metabolic response to meals (based on the link with salivary amylase). The test was done in triplicate and involved recording the time taken to perceive a sweet taste while chewing a plain cracker.</p><p>In the US, on 15 November 2018, UK protocol v1.3 was mirrored and approved by the Partners Healthcare IRB as PREDICT-US v1.0 The first two participants were enrolled in December 2018. On 3 January 2019, the IRB approved an amendment (PREDICT-US v2.0) to address meal changes introduced in the UK for Group 3 and to allow the use of multiple CGMs on the same participant. No other major amendments to the intervention protocol were made during the study period in the US. Minor amendments were made to improve recruitment (addition of direct advertisements and patient repositories, for example) or administrative changes to study staff.</p>"
